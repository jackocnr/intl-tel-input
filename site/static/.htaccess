# 1. REMOVE TRAILING SLASH
# If a user/browser asks for /playground/, redirect to /playground
# (this was happening on my mobile due to it's (301 Moved Permanently) cache, since we previously had a playground directory, so it had been redirecting from /playground to /playground/)

# 2. REMOVE .HTML EXTENSION (External Redirect)
# If a user types /playground.html, redirect them to /playground

# 3. MAP CLEAN URL TO FILE (Internal Rewrite)
