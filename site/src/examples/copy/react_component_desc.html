<p>We now have our own React component! Play with it in the <a href="/playground">Playground</a>! You can view a full list of <a href="https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input/blob/master/react/README.md">all supported props here</a>. See <a href="https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input/blob/master/react/demo/validation/ValidationApp.tsx">ValidationApp</a> for a demo of how to use the validation props. To run the demos yourself, follow the instructions in the Demo section of the <a href="https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input/blob/master/react/README.md">readme</a>. Typescript type definitions included.</p>
