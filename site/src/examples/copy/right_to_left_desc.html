<p>In this demo, we add <code>dir="rtl"</code> to the plugin container to make the layout run from right to left (though the phone input and dropdown dial codes are still left-to-right as phone numbers should always be written/displayed that way). We also import and use the Arabic locale, and initialise the plugin with the initial country set to Egypt.</p>
