<p>This project includes an official Angular component alongside the original JavaScript plugin. It supports all of the same features, including the country picker, formatting, and validation, and comes with TypeScript type definitions included. View all of the supported props in the <a href="/docs/angular-component">Angular component</a> docs.</p>

<p>Below is a live demo and example code demonstrating <code>ReactiveFormsModule</code> integration, validation (on blur/submit), and error messaging. For more patterns and use cases, explore the <a href="https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input/tree/master/angular/demo">Angular demos</a>.</p>
