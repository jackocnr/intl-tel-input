<p>DANGER: Various countries around the world update their number rules every month, so <code>isValidNumberPrecise</code> will start rejecting valid numbers unless you constantly keep it up-to-date e.g. via an automated script. For this reason, we strongly recommend sticking to <a href="/examples/validation-practical.html">the standard validation method</a> which is much more stable as it only checks number length rules, which rarely change.</p>

<p><code>isValidNumberPrecise</code> respects the <code>allowedNumberTypes</code> option, which is set to <code>["MOBILE"]</code> by default, meaning it will only return <code>true</code> for mobile numbers.</p>

<p>If <code>isValidNumberPrecise</code> returns <code>false</code>, and you'd like more detail, you can then use the <code>getValidationError</code> method to get more information. This method returns an <a rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input/blob/master/src/js/utils.js#L148">error code</a> (integer), which you can then map to your own custom error message, as in the example below.</p>

<p>All validation methods require the utils script to be loaded (see the readme for instructions). The utils script contains a custom build of Google's <a rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/google/libphonenumber">libphonenumber</a> library in JavaScript, which provides validation tools as well as formatting and placeholder number generation.</p>
