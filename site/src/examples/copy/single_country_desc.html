<p>Even if you only need to handle numbers from a single country, the plugin can still be helpful. It can provide an example number for the placeholder, formatting as-you-type, as well as validation. The user can type their number in national format and then you can use <a href="/docs/methods#getnumber"><code>getNumber</code></a> to get the number in standardised international format to store in your database. In this example, we've set <a href="/docs/options#onlycountries"><code>onlyCountries</code></a> to a single country: United States, and we've disabled <a href="/docs/options#allowdropdown"><code>allowDropdown</code></a> as well as <a href="/docs/options#showflags"><code>showFlags</code></a>. Play with these options in the <a href="/playground?allowDropdown=false&onlyCountries=%5B%22us%22%5D&showFlags=false">Playground</a>.</p>
