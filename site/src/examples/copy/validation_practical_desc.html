<p>It is important to validate any user input before saving it to your backend. The <a href="/docs/methods#isvalidnumber"><code>isValidNumber</code></a> method provides a simple form of validation that only checks the number length, which should be sufficient for most use cases. The advantage of this simple approach is that it is much more future-proof as while countries around the world regularly update their number rules, they very rarely change their number lengths. For a more precise (and much less stable) form of validation, see <a href="/examples/validation-precise">Precise Validation (dangerous)</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/docs/methods#isvalidnumber"><code>isValidNumber</code></a> respects the <a href="/docs/options#allowednumbertypes"><code>allowedNumberTypes</code></a> option, which is set to <code>["MOBILE", "FIXED_LINE"]</code> by default, meaning it will only return <code>true</code> for those types of numbers.</p>

<p>If <a href="/docs/methods#isvalidnumber"><code>isValidNumber</code></a> returns <code>false</code> and you'd like more detail, you can then use the <a href="/docs/methods#getvalidationerror"><code>getValidationError</code></a> method to get more information. This method returns an <a rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input/blob/master/src/js/utils.js#L148">error code</a> (integer), which you can then map to your own custom error message, as in the example below.</p>

<p>All validation methods require the utils script to be loaded (see the readme for instructions). The utils script contains a custom build of Google's <a rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/google/libphonenumber">libphonenumber</a> library in JavaScript, which provides validation tools as well as formatting and placeholder number generation.</p>
