<p>When you want to display a user's number back to them, in your HTML you can just set the input's value to the full international number before you initialise International Telephone Input. The plugin will automatically select the relevant flag, and re-format the number to national format (unless you set <code>nationalMode</code> to false). We recommend that internally, you always deal with numbers in full international format, and then through the plugin, the user can always deal with numbers in the familiar national format. Note that reformating the number in this way requires the utils script to be loaded via the <code>loadUtils</code> option. The utils script is a custom build of Google's libphonenumber library in JavaScript, which we use for all formatting, validation and generating placeholder numbers.
